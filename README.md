Usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one 
of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are 
"rock" (a closed fist), 
"paper" (a flat hand), and 
"scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger 
extended, forming a V). 
Rules of the game:

Rock will win against scissor because rock can crush the scissor.
