# RockPaperScissor game
Usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one 
of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are 
"rock" (a closed fist), 
"paper" (a flat hand), and 
"scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger 
extended, forming a V). 
Rules of the game:
Throw a move forming the above mentioned shapes.
Rock will lose against paper because paper can wrap the rock and rock will win against scissor because rock can crush the scissor.
Paper will lose against scissor because scissor can cut the paper into pieces.
